Dear Beloved,

Greetings in the Name of our Lord Jesus. I am Ms. Kathryn Webb a 75-years
old woman living in United Kingdom. According to our bible in Ecclesiastes
1:2 which says &#8220;Vanity of vanities, said the preacher, vanity of
vanities; all is vanity. I am a dying woman who God has touched in a
glorious way to fulfill His blessing toward charity/Mankind.

In One (1) year ago I was diagnosed with cancer of the breast. I have
asked God for forgiveness and I believed He has because He is a merciful
God. I will be going in for an operation on Friday, which the Doctor has
indirectly said is 50/50 chance of surviving. Beloved, I got your contact
from your country business directory and decided to contact you on this
project of God.

I have decided to WILL/donate the sum of $10.2Million USD (Ten Million Two
Hundred Thousand Dollars) to you for the good work of God and to serve His
divine purpose and favor to humanity. Due to my health situation, I am
only privilege to send you this letter with the help of a lady nurse here
who has be so kind to me.

My family lawyer is aware of the fact that I am ready to adjust my WILL
for this purpose, I will advice you contact her about the subject matter
for WILL adjustment and she we instruct you on the proceeding and
instruction to get the WILL adjust; she will notify me in the hospital for
further clarification to signed the necessary column of the WILL. My
Family Lawyer information is Mrs. Angela Robertson Email:
angela.rob@lawyer.com United Kingdom. She will instruct you on every
step/information needed to get this done.

All I ask of you is to make sure that you use this fund for the work of
God to fulfill His divine purpose and favor to humanity. It is clear that
I don&#8217;t know you BUT God known you more than I can ever do. For this
purpose I bow my knees and pray for you, May the Lord bless you abundantly
as you fulfill this mystery toward charity and Humanitarian service. Thus,
you are to use 50% of the funds for this Humanitarian Mission while 10%
goes to my family Lawyer and 40% goes to you for your faithfulness toward
God and mankind.

Lastly, I want you to pray for me regarding my health situation, because I
have come to find out that to everything there is a season; and a time to
every purpose under the heaven. (Ecclesiastes 3:1&#8211;8) May the Grace
of our Lord, the love of God, and the sweet fellowship of the Holy Spirit
be with you now and forever more, Amen.

Yours Faithfully

Ms. Kathryn Webb
