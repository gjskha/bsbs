bsbs - Bayesian Spamfilter in Bash Shell

I have a Unix shell account with no ability to install software, and I needed
to block spam.  So I am experimenting with a shell script that uses a
Bayesian-like filtering algorithm.  I used the following web pages as a
guideline:

http://www.process.com/precisemail/bayesian_example.htm
http://www.vjs.org/spam/bayesian-analysis.html

There are still a few kinks to work out, and as with all things spam, how it
performs in actual practice will determine future direction.

TBD: integrating with mutt & procmail
